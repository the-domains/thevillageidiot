I love playing Chess, and I am competitive
I study a lot - do training tactics and read lots of books on Chess.
But sometimes reading gets in the way.
Sometimes I read too many books and don't play enough actual games. 

Lately, I've been reading a lot about story.
I've enjoyed the recent courses I've done on the history of languages and the development of writing.
I have recently listened to a 40 course of lectures by the famed linguist John McWhorter.

"Proust and the Squid - the story and science of the reading brain." by Maryanne Wolf is a great read.

Sometimes I read so much about Story, Language and reading ...that I don't read enough actual stories.
This made me think about my relationship with the scriptures.
Sometimes I read too many books.  

I love - "The Message - Catholic / Ecumenical Edition - The Bible in Contemporary Language" Translated by Eugen Patterson with additional translation by William Griffin. 

This Holy Week I focused on just one Gospel - Matthew
I pretended that this one Gospel was the only one I had - the only one I would ever have to know about Jesus
I become one with the story - in Contemporary Language - I loved it.
All the time at church this week I saw the Jesus I had met in Matthew
I have spoken about the Message before - I love it ....and it still has me rushing back to my New Jerusalem to check things out.
But 

I've been very happy just meeting Jesus in the Bible as opposed to reading about how I should read to find him. 

This is something we should consider in our careers - Do we stray from our core business in the quest to develop ourselves? 

Is there a risk of over-development?
I don't know the answers....but I think we should still ask the questions
