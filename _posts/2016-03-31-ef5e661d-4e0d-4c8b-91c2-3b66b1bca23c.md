I enjoy using social media -- Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest. I use them personally as well as for Mariannhill Mission Press and then again for some of our customers.

There are three hats for me to wear:  
-- Me  
--[Mariannhill Mission Press][0]  
-- Our Customers

Sometimes I just need to get down and focus on a particular task, like writing copy for a brochure; editing a book, or doing research. I am so used to messages popping up and then checking up on a profile. Nonstop social media monitoring is very distracting and quickly can become a bad habit -- hooked on the adrenalin of the hit of a "post", "Comment" or "like."...and time slips away like custard on a granite kitchen top counter....forever.

Introducing a super cool app called Freedom.

Subscribe to the service at $6,99 per month or pay $25 for a year to activate the service.

Freedom is a site blocking service built to bring out the beast in your productivity.

-- Create your account  
-- Pay  
-- register your devices  
-- create you blocking lists

This is cool because you can create different lists with different types of sites to block:  
e.g., A. How I pay for my Porsche -- which blocks everything except my email  
B. Magazines and News -- blocks all my favourite magazine sites  
C. Social -- blocks all my social media sites

-- Then choose how long you want your blocking session to be -- I usually prefer an hour at a time.  
-- Then I get down to work.

If you try and go to any site you have blocked -- BOOMED BIG GREEN BUTTERFLY -- you can't get access until your time is up.  
There is no Kill Switch -- no back door.  
Once you are locked out -- you are locked out until the time runs out.

You can run it on your phone at the same time as well -- so as you choose a list on your desktop or laptop and as if my magic your phone shuts down in the same way at the same time. There is no cheating. (Well there is -- but I like pretending ....I mean I have legitimate work to do.)

I am in love with this focusing tool -- You may think I am weak, that I must have no willpower and a short and ADD attention span -- but remember that this is a big part of my job. So when I need to focus this tool makes it super simple for me.

Type "[Freedom.to][1]" into your browser and smile, you are soon to be knighted in the realm of Social Media

I call the butterfly Hulk because like Hulk, the service is solid and green. The App works on Mac and Windows as well as OS for Mac and Google's Android. It's a big win for me. Thank you Flutterby Hulk!
